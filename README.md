Developer tools for OpenWhisk
=============================


### Installing OpenWhisk

* Using Docker-Compose. See the [README](docker-compose/README.md) for more details. 
 
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openwhisk/openwhisk-devtools.svg?branch=docker-compose)](https://travis-ci.org/openwhisk/openwhisk-devtools)
  
  ```bash
  cd docker-compose
  make quick-start
  ```
  
  This is useful for creating local development environments. 
  The build downloads by default the latest code from the master branch, but it also allows developers to work with their local clones by providing the local path to the OpenWhisk repo:
      
  ```bash
  PROJECT_HOME=/path/to/openwhisk make quick-start
  ```    

### Travis builds

Each tool in this repository has to provide travis build scripts inside a `.travis` folder. 
The folder should define 2 scripts:
* `setup.sh` - invoked during `before_install` phase 
* `build.sh` - invokes during `script` phase 

For an example check out [docker-compose/.travis](docker-compose/.travis) folder.
