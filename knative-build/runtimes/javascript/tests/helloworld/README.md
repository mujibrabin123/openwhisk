# Hello World Test for OpenWhisk NodeJS Runtime using Knative

## Running the test using the "Curl" command

Depending on the value you set in [buildtemplate.yaml](../../buildtemplate.yaml) for the ```OW_RUNTIME_PLATFORM``` parameter, you will need to invoke different endpoints to execute the test.

### Running with OW_RUNTIME_PLATFORM set to "knative"

#### Invoke / endpoint on the Service

```
curl -H "Host: nodejs-helloworld.default.example.com" -X POST http://localhost/
```

### Running with OW_RUNTIME_PLATFORM set to "openwhisk"

#### Initialize the runtime

Initialize the runtime with the function and other configuration data using the ```/init``` endpoint.

```
curl -H "Host: nodejs-helloworld.default.example.com" -d "@data-init.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost/init

{"OK":true}
```

#### Run the function

Execute the function using the ```/run``` endpoint.

```
curl -H "Host: nodejs-helloworld.default.example.com" -d "@data-run.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost/run

{"payload":"Hello"}
```
